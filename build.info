 Introduction
  ============
  The project <code>AbstractFactory</code> is an example implementation of the Creational Design Pattern:
   - AbstractFactory
   - Singleton

  Designing object-oriented software is hard, and designing reusable object-oriented software is even harder.
  Experienced object-oriented designers will tell you that a reusable and flexible design is difficult
  if not impossible to get "right" the first time.
  Before a design is finished, they usually try to reuse it several times, modifying it each time.

  The given implementation is made with the following purpose:
   1. Complete working example of the pattern written in PHP.
   2. Complete building by the client without any extra tools.
   3. No External Libraries needed.
   4. The code-example is made to explain the pattern in PHP and not to explain PHP.

   How to use
   ==========
   The following actions are required:
   - Extract Archive-file into a directory of your choice.
   - Open a terminal window (UNIX) or a DOS Command window (Windows).
